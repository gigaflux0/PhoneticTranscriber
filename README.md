# PhoneticTranscriber
Get and insert easily readable phonetic translations of English words in Microsoft Office apps.

TODO:
- Multi word support.
- Word insertion button.
- Auto-insertion tick box.
- Readability enhancements by implementing: 
        - syllable dash breaks, 
        - bolding stressed sounds, 
        - italicizing nasaled sounds.
- Spell check forcer.
- Host code on an azure server.


COMPLETED:
- Entire prototype base to build upon.
- Proper error control.
- Translation improvments.
- Fix Cross-Origin-Resource-SHaring issue (fixable to doing a complete dictionary change, best looking candidate is wiktionary).
- Convert translation case switches to hashtables.
- Overwrite previously displayed result rather than concat to it.


SETUP:
Install Visual Studio (Preferably Community Edition 2015 with Update 1).
Install the VS office tools at this link: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx

(NetBeans netdev IDE is good for debugging if trying to figure out issues sometimes).
